# Advent of Code 2020

See https://adventofcode.com/2020/

The core logic for each day is in a separate file, but everything can be
run from the main program.

My solutions are in Kotlin, because I like the language and want to
practice it more.

There are unit tests which sometimes go beyond the strict requirements of
the AoC specifications or inputs. For example, on day 1 it handles the case
of duplicate values appearing in the input, although no such values actually
appeared in the supplied file.

I like to try to find a generally functional-style solution, even if there
may be a simpler procedural approach because, again, it's good practice (in
both senses of that phrase).
